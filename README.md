# MOVIE_RECOMMENDATION_SYSTEM

There are 3 ways to implement a Movie Recommendation System

1. Content Based
2. Collabrative filtering based
3. Hybrid 

We are going to implement this project by Content Based technique.

First I am going to collaborate data of both csv file into one, 
Then i am going to perform data cleaning and remove unwanted rows and columns,
Next step would be to create TAGS for each movie.
Finally we will do vectorization and give results.
